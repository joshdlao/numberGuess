## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The game generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
2. The player selects a **difficulty level**:
   - **Easy** â€“ 10 chances
   - **Medium** â€“ 5 chances
   - **Hard** â€“ 3 chances
3. The player enters guesses one by one.
4. The game provides feedback:
   - "The number is less than your guess" or
   - "The number is greater than your guess"
5. If the player guesses correctly, they win.
6. If the player uses all attempts without guessing, the game reveals the correct number.
7. After the game ends, the player can choose to **restart** or **exit**.
